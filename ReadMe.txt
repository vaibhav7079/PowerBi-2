Goal of the Project:
Working with data sets using Power BI Tool. 
we should be able to analyze data and answer the key business questions with the help of
 dashboards and report and derive insights.
 Also, we should document & communicate the insights and findings from the data

Business Case:
As analyst and we are working for leading e-commerce client. 
The client asked we to create analytical dash boards  below themes.
•	Overview about various KPI’s
•	Pricing & Promotion
•	Search & Recommendations etc.
While building dashboards, we are expected to clean the data if required. Once we clean the data, 
we need to answer below questions as part of the documentation
a.	What variables can be derived out of the data which can be helpful?
b.	Who can use this dashboard?
c.	What value would be generated by using this dashboard ?
d.	What additional data can be helpful to add more insights & value to the team?


Final Deliverables:
a.	Analytics Dashboard using Power BI Tool
